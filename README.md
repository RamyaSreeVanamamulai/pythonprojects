# pythonprojects:

I’m sharing a collection of basic Python projects here. Each project is saved in a separate file, with filenames named according to the project’s purpose. This README provides a brief description of each project and its code.

 
1. 🎲 Dice Rolling Game
A simple Python command-line dice rolling game. This script simulates rolling two 6-sided dice. Users can choose to continue rolling or exit the game.

📝 Description
This program allows the user to:

Press y to roll the dice, which generates two random numbers between 1 and 6 (inclusive).

Press n to stop the game and display a thank-you message.

Enter anything else to receive an Invalid choice message.

💡 Features
Random number generation using Python's random module.

Input validation for user interaction.

Looping mechanism to allow multiple rolls.

📦 Requirements
Python 3.x

No additional packages are required.

▶️ How to Run
Clone this repository or copy the script into a .py file.

Run the script using Python

Follow the on-screen instructions:

Any other input will show "Invalid choice!"



2.🎯 Number Guessing Game
This is a simple Python command-line game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

📝 Description
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.

The user is prompted to guess the number.

After each guess, the program provides feedback:

"Too high" if the guess is higher than the number.

"Too low" if the guess is lower than the number.

"Congratulations" if the guess is correct.

If the user enters a non-numeric value (like a letter or symbol), the program displays "enter a valid number".
